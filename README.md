I developed a comprehensive Java-based project focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This application was designed for a car company to manage vehicle orders based on selected customer preferences and specifications.

The system allows users to customize car features such as engine type, color, interior design, and additional options, ensuring a highly personalized experience. Leveraging the power of OOP, the project features modular, reusable, and scalable code, making it easy to adapt and extend.

Key functionalities include tracking orders, calculating prices dynamically based on selected features, and generating detailed order summaries. This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement real-world software solutions while adhering to OOP principles, showcasing strong analytical and coding skills
